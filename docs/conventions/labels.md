# Issue Labels Guidelines

This project uses a standardized set of **labels** to organize, prioritize, and streamline issue management.  
Each label has a clear purpose to ensure consistent communication across contributors.

## bug
**Description:** Something isnâ€™t working as expected.  
**Use when:** Reporting defects, malfunctions, or unintended behaviors in the system.

## design
**Description:** Visual and UX/UI work such as mockups, prototypes, or style guides.
**Use when:** A task involves product look, feel, or user experience before/alongside development.

## documentation
**Description:** Improvements or additions to documentation.  
**Use when:** Updating guides, fixing typos, or creating new documentation.

## enhancement
**Description:** New feature or request.  
**Use when:** Suggesting improvements, optimizations, or additional functionality.

## priority: high (P0)
**Description:** To be treated immediately.  
**Use when:** Critical issues that block progress or severely impact users.

## priority: medium (P1)
**Description:** Important but not blocking.  
**Use when:** Issues that should be addressed soon but are not emergencies.

## priority: low (P2)
**Description:** Nice-to-have, low urgency.  
**Use when:** Non-blocking improvements, optimizations, or ideas.

## question
**Description:** Clarification or discussion needed.  
**Use when:** Asking questions, requesting feedback, or exploring ideas.

## task
**Description:** Organizational or technical work.  
**Use when:** Handling chores such as refactoring, CI/CD setup, or configuration.

## user-story
**Description:** Functional story describing a user need.  
**Use when:** Writing issues from the perspective of the end-user.

### Labeling Rules
- Every issue **must have at least one type label** (`bug`, `enhancement`, `task`, etc.).  
- Add a **priority label** (`priority: high`, `priority: medium`, `priority: low`) if applicable.  
- Combine with `question` or `user-story` when additional context is required.  

_This labeling system ensures that **Issues** are consistently categorized and prioritized, making collaboration clearer and more efficient._
