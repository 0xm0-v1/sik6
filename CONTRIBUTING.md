# Contributing Guidelines – sik6

This document defines the contribution rules for the **sik6** project.  
All team members are expected to follow these conventions to ensure consistency and maintainability.

## Standards
- [Commits](./docs/conventions/commits.md)  
- [Labels](./docs/conventions/labels.md)  
- [Images](./docs/conventions/images.md)  
- [Linting](./docs/conventions/lint.md) 

## Workflow
1. Create a branch from `main`.  
2. Implement and test your changes locally.  
3. Commit your changes — pre-commit hooks will automatically enforce linting and conventions.  
4. Open a Pull Request for review and approval before merging.
