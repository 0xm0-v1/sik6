# Contributing Guidelines â€“ sik6

This document defines the contribution rules for the **sik6** project.  
All team members are expected to follow these conventions to ensure consistency and maintainability.

## Standards
- [Commits](./docs/conventions/commits.md)  
- [Labels](./docs/conventions/labels.md)  
- [Images](./docs/conventions/images.md)  

## Workflow
1. Create a branch from `main` (`feature/...`, `fix/...`, etc.).  
2. Implement and test your changes locally.  
3. Open a Pull Request for review and approval before merging.
